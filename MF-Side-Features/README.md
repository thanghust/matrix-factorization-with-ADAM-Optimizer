# Matrix Factorization for Collaborative Filtering with Side Features

This is my PyTorch implementation of a Matrix Factorization model for Collaborative Filtering. This model adds in "side" features, especially useful in cold-start situations.

## Requirements
```
PyTorch 1.3 & Python 3.6
Numpy
Pandas
Pytorch-Ignite
Sklearn
TensorboardX
```

## Scripts
* [loader.py](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/MetaRec/blob/master/Matrix-Factorization-Experiments/MF-Side-Features/loader.py): This is the script that loads the data.
* [MFSideFeat.py](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/MetaRec/blob/master/Matrix-Factorization-Experiments/MF-Side-Features/MFSideFeat.py): This is the model script that defines the Matrix Factorization model with side features.
* [train.py](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/MetaRec/blob/master/Matrix-Factorization-Experiments/MF-Side-Features/train.py): This is the main training script. You can simply run `python train.py` to execute it.

## Results
The full results are stored in [this folder](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/MetaRec/tree/master/Matrix-Factorization-Experiments/MF-Side-Features/results).
After training the model for 50 epochs with 75/25 train-test split, I got the training loss MSE = 0.6602 and test loss MSE = 0.7843 with training time = 13m34s.

## Run Tensorboard In The Background
While I am using PyTorch instead of Tensorflow directly, the logging and visualization library Tensorboard is an amazing asset to track the progress of our models.
It's implemented as a small local web server that constructs visualizations from log files, so start by kicking it off in the background:

```
tensorboard --logdir runs
```
